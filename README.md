 # Simple Address Book
 A program that can be used to maintain an address book. An address book holds a collection of entries,
 each recording a person's first and last names, address, city, state, zip, and phone number.  
 
 It must be possible to add a new person to an address book, to edit existing information about a person (except the person's name), and to delete a person.   
 It must be possible to sort the entries in the address book alphabetically by last name (with ties broken by first name if necessary), or by ZIP code (with ties broken by name if necessary).  
 It must be possible to print out all the entries in the address book in "mailing label" format.
